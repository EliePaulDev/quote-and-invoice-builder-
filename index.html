                    <p>A Quote and Invoice Builder app helps you manage the business side of your work without needing to be a finance expert. Quotes are estimates you give clients before starting a job, showing what the work will cost. Invoices are official bills you send after completing the job to get paid. This app makes it easy by guiding you through creating clear, professional-looking documents with all the important details—like services, prices, and due dates. It keeps everything organized in one place, so you don’t lose track of what’s owed, what’s been paid, and helps you look professional while getting paid on time.</p>
